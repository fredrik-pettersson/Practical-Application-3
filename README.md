# Practical-Application-3
This project is about improving the success of marketing campaigns to get clients to open new bank accounts. 
A major bank in Portugal wants to improve how it targets existing clients and understand what key factors drive its clients to open new bank accounts.  

As part of the assignment, the performance of the classifiers K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines is evaluated on a dataset containing 41,188 client samples and 20 different features including client age, type of employment, marital status, education, previous loan defaults, existing home loans, personal loans, number of previous client contacts, and month and day of marketing outreach.    

# Executive Summary
A dataset containing information on 41,188 clients of a Portugese bank gathered from multiple marketing campaigns was evaluated to identify what key characteristics drive the successful opening of new bank accounts as a result of targeted marketing activities to existing clients. 

Based on the findings of the project, the main recommendation is to increase the number of interactions with existing clients, as this is by far the most significant driver of marketing campaign and business success. Another recommendation is to carry out targeted marketing campaigns primarily during the months of March and October, followed by the months of September and May. Finally, the targeting of clients who are retired as well as students has a relatively high correlation with the successful opening of new bank accounts. 

The machine learning models that performed the best were K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees, which were able to reach classification accuracies of close to 90%. However, more work remains in incorporating additional features such as macro economic indicators and optimizing the models further, but this is outside of the scope of this project. 

# Initial Hypothesis
Abdcdefgh

The most important information feature by far that drives marketing campaign and business success is the number of previous interactions with the client, followed by marketing campaigns that take place in particular during the months of March and October, as well as the months of September and May. Other significant variables include clients who are retired and students.
