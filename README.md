# Practical-Application-3
This project is about improving the success of marketing campaigns to get clients to open new bank accounts. 
A major bank in Portugal wants to improve how it targets existing clients and understand what key factors drive its clients to open new bank accounts.  
As part of the assignment, the performance of the classifiers K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines is evaluated on a dataset containing 41,188 client samples and 20 different features including client age, type of employment, marital status, education, previous loan defaults, existing home loans, personal loans, number of previous client contacts, and month and day of marketing outreach.
